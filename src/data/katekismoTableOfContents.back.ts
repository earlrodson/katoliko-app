          by the power of the Holy Spirit
        he was born of the Virgin Mary,
        and became man.
        He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
        was crucified, died, and was buried.
        He descended into hell.
          For our sake he was crucified
        under Pontius Pilate;
        he suffered died and was buried.
        On the third day he rose again.
          On the third day he rose again
        in fulfillment of the Scriptures;
        He ascended into heaven
        and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
        He will come again to judge
        the living and the dead 	he ascended into heaven
        and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
        He will come again in glory
        to judge the living and the dead,
        and his kingdom will have no end.
        I believe in the Holy Spirit,
        the holy catholic Church,
        the communion of saints,
        the forgiveness of sins,
        the resurrection of the body,
        and the life everlasting.
        Amen.
          
        We believe in the Holy Spirit,
        the Lord, the giver of life,
        who proceeds from the
        Father and the Son.
        With the Father and the Son
        he is worshipped and glorified.
        He has spoken through the Prophets.
        We believe in one holy
        catholic and apostolic Church.
        We acknowledge one
        baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
        We look for the resurrection of the dead,
        and the life of the world to come.
        Amen.`,
